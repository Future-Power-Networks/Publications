# Case-study for the Grey-Box Approach 

<div style="text-align: justify">This folder provides all codes and data for the 68-bus case study in our paper 'Participation Analysis in Impedance Models: TheGrey-Box Approach for Power System Stability'.

* Numerical results for Grey-Box Layer-1, Layer-2, Layer-3 are stored in the folder 'Results', so as the time-domain simulation results.
* The configuration files of the network and the apparatus are located in the folder 'SystemConfiguration'.
* Codes can be found in <https://github.com/Future-Power-Networks/Simplex-Power-Systems/tree/GreyBox_Paper>. The codes are specially customized for the case study in the paper, so do NOT creat your own case upon these codes as they may create unwanted results. If you hope to develop your own project based on our toolbox, please fork the 'Main' branch.
