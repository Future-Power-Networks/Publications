# Supplementary Files

Here we list the access to the codes used for our article *The intrinsic communication in power systems: a new perspective to understand stability*

* Codes for channel bandwith analysis, dynamic frequency shift analysis, IEEE 68-bus system analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/Future-Power-Networks/Power-Communication-Isomorphism). For getting the EMT simulation results of IEEE 68-bus systems, [toolbox](https://github.com/Future-Power-Networks/Simplus-Grid-Tool/tree/PowerCommunication) should be installed beforehand. 

* The codes are specially customized for the case-study in the paper, so do NOT create your own case upon these codes as they may generate unwanted results. If you hope to develop your own project based on our toolbox, please fork from the [master branch](https://github.com/Future-Power-Networks/Simplus-Grid-Tool).

If you have further questions, please contact the authors.
