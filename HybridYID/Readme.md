Archived for paper 'Hybrid Data/Model-Driven Whole-System Admittance Identification via Single-Point Injections'

* The whole case study was established based on the [Simplus Grid Tool](https://github.com/Future-Power-Networks/Simplus-Grid-Tool).
* The system data, including lines, loads, and IBR parameters are in the spreadsheet SystemParameters.xlsx.
* The GFL-IBR control loop is generally the same as the default IBR model in Simplus Grid Tool, but with an additional outer loop to control the magnitude of Vac by changing reactive power Q. An integration part was used, i.e., I-control
* Due to the project ristrictions, the EMT model and the scripts for whole-system admittance identification are not disclosed.
