# Supplementary Files for Whole-System Models 

<div style="text-align: justify">Here we list the access to the codes used for our paper **Impedance-Based Whole-System Modeling for a Composite Grid via Embedding of Frame Dynamics**.

* Codes can be found [here](https://github.com/Future-Power-Networks/Simplex-Power-Systems/tree/WholeSystem). The codes are specially customized for the case-study in the paper, so do NOT create your own case upon these codes as they may generate unwanted results. If you hope to develop your own project based on our toolbox, please fork from the [master branch](https://github.com/Future-Power-Networks/Simplex-Power-Systems).
